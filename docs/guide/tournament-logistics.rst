Tournament Logistics
====================

Unlike the rest of our documentation this section does not concern particular features or technical concerns with Tabbycat itself. Instead it is an attempt to outline the logistics of tab direction and aims to be of general relevance for people running medium and large tournaments. At present it is organised by the various ‘stages' of tabbing a tournament, and most  content takes the form of check-lists or comments designed to highlight and provide guidance on common issues. To reduce clutter in the rest of the documentation it is formatted as a single page; using the sub-sections in the sidebar is recommended for navigating across sections.

While this guide aims for general relevance, we should note that it is relatively opinionated and written mostly from the perspective of people whose primary experience is tabbing at Australasian tournaments using Tabbycat. That said we welcome feedback and additions that can account for different format and regional considerations. In the future, if the guide becomes more general and more extensive, it could be spun off into a separate project.

.. note:: As with the rest of our documentation, this page is open-source and we welcome :ref:`feedback and contributions <contributing>`.

Planning and Preparation
========================

This section aims to outline concerns that occur in the months before the tournament: after you have agreed to help with tabbing and while the org-com and adj-core are deciding how they want to run key processes such as registration and feedback. It is organised in terms of who you should coordinate with in order to plan for a well-tabbed tournament.

General
-------

- You should try avoid being the sole person responsible for that tab unless it is a small tournament. There are many cases where you want to be in several places at once and the easiest way to accommodate that is by having co-directors or trusted assistants. Few tab decisions require a single source of authority; it is far better to have multiple people available to share responsibilities around.
- In a similar manner, it is worth considering how you can use the tournament to help train other people. Typically knowledge of tabbing is concentrated in relatively few people and gained mostly through on-the-ground experience; meaning that every tournament can be approached as an opportunity to train new people. Consider reaching out to institutions or the tournament as a whole to see if they have anyone who would be interested in helping.

Convenors
---------

It might sound obvious but it will pay to have a very thorough conversation about the tab process (more or less the contents of this document) with the convenors a few months out from the tournament. Do this even if you know the convenors to be knowledgeable or experienced debaters. Key concerns are:

- Whether internet access will be available and whether participants can be presumed to have smart phones. This has an obvious impact on how online feedback, ballots, and draw release is done. Note that Eduroam is not necessarily a reliable guarantee of access; many universities can't access it or set up is often something that is difficult or requires students do so while at their home institution.
- What kind of room is the tab room going to be? Is it possible to optimize its placement when the bookings for rooms are made? Key details include: How large is it?  Does it have a sufficient amount of desk space (for data entry)? Does it have a good projector (for allocations)?
- What kind of printers will be available? Can the tournament buy/borrow one? This is obviously a key consideration for pre-printed ballots. Also try and ensure there are back-up printing options if possible; clearly stipulate your need for ink and paper; and try and opt for a black/white laserjet, over an inkjet, if possible.
- What kind of volunteers will be available? How many, and what is their experience level? As a very broad recommendation, you probably want around 1 volunteers for every 10 rooms, assuming volunteers are performing a dual role as data-enterers and ballot-collectors.
- Will the tournament make a donation to Tabbycat or whoever maintains the tabbing software you are using? Note that this is required if the tournament is generating a profit for the host institution or it's organisers. Accounting officers should also be aware that there will be some costs associated with hosting the tab. You should also ensure that people helping with the tab are fairly compensated for their flights, registration, etc and that any volunteers are invited along to socials and/or given some other recompense.
- Will Swing teams be available? You should plan to have one more than you need. For example, with 79 teams, you should have both an 80th swing team to fill in the draw, and the option to easily assemble an 81st swing team in case a team goes AWOL.
- Ensure that food will be brought to tab room. Otherwise you will starve and the adjudication core will swan off to lunch.
- How will critical information be communicated to participants? Consider that in general, Facebook announcements do not reach many people, although paying to boost the posts is often a very cheap way of dramatically raising their effectiveness. In particular also ensure or check how you manage to get in touch with teams or adjudicators who go AWOL: will they have reliable phone numbers? Can you get a list of institutional reps who can be reliably called? You want to have processes in place for chasing up adjudicators who do things such as make scoring mistakes as soon as possible in order to minimise delays.
- At large tournaments you want to arrive at least a day before check-in; and ideally whenever it is that the adjudication core is arriving for their preparation.

Registration
------------

Having effective registration systems and processes is one of the most important aspects of preparing to tab a large tournament. Bad registration data *will* make setting up a tab extremely painful and introduces the chance for mistakes or inconsistencies in tab data that will only come to light in the first round. As such:

- You should check in with the registration team and see what they plan to do as soon as possible after being brought on-board. As part of this you should make it clear that you should be consulted on any decisions they make about what data to collect, when to collect it, and how to collect it.
- Registration data should be collected into a shared and live-updating source, such as a Google Sheet. There should be as few canonical sources (ideally one) of data as possible; i.e. there should be a single sheet for individual details, a single sheet for team details, etc; and these should be maintained all the way through to check-in. For both you, and the registration team, having multiple conflicting or outdated copies of data will lead to errors. However for the registration team these errors can usually be easily sorted out in person (at check-in) but for you that information always needs to have a data-trail otherwise what is imported into the tab will quickly become incorrect.

    - At this point our recommendation is to, in most cases, use specialised registration systems as they are somewhat inflexible and less intuitive than Google forms/sheets.

- You should have access to all of the data collected; often registration teams will make (false) assumptions about what you do or do not need. It is better to have everything and then selectively filter out (when needed) what you do not want.
- It is critical that the registration team should check in with you before setting up forms asking for information. Every additional time that registration asks for data there will be less and less participation in the process, so you should aim to gather all that you need at the first opportunity; typically during the canonical individual registration phase. Particular information that should not be overlooked for tab purposes:

    - Individual registration should ask for a person's team name/number (reconciling these later is painful).
    - Individual registration should ask for any accessibility requirements people may have.
    - Individual registration should ask for the previous institutions of adjudicators.
    - Individual registration should ask for the email addresses of all participants.
    - Individual registration should ask for the phone numbers of adjudicators.

- Independent adjudicators and the adjudication core should follow normal registration procedures. Having them not go through the normal process makes it easy to overlook their data or not get a complete picture of it. For example adjudication core members might forget to nominate conflicts, or neglect to provide their previous institutions.
- You should confirm how the registration team plans to manage check-in in particular. Check-in is when issues with registration data come to light and it is vital that these changes are noted and recorded. Some form of validation of registration data *must* occur at check-in — in particular all adjudicators should be (individually) verified as present and all members of a team should confirm their presence along with team name/number and their speakers.
- After checkin you need to have a definitive list of who is physically present at the tournament so you can run a first-round draw with confidence. Registration must know this and have processes in place for recording people individually as they arrive, and for that data to filter back to you.
- If you are using Tabbycat's secret links for feedback or ballots these are best distributed at check-in. Rego should know about this, prepare for it, and be provided with the pdfs to print and distribute.

Adjudication cores
------------------

CA/DCA's will often leave tab-relevant decisions until the days prior to the first round or whenever it is that they can meet with the tab team in person. However this often wastes critical time and forces rushed decisions. Many considerations can instead be raised and discussed prior to the tournament.

- If there is a group chat for the adjudication core you probably want to be part of it; even if you don't contribute much. There are lots of small things that end up being discussed without consideration of how they will affect tab issues. It is also a chance to get to know — ahead of time — the people you will be working with closely over the tournament.
- How to managing the adjudicator feedback process is also something that benefits from foresight and pre-planning, rather than being decided on the ground. Key considerations are:

    - What is the score scale going to be? What do each of those numbers represent? How will this be communicated to participants?
    - How much weight does a test score have over the course of the tournament? By Round 3, or by Round 8, what proportion of an adjudicator's score is derived from their test? Etc.
    - Who submits feedback on whom? Do trainees do so on chairs? Etc.
    - Is feedback mandatory? If so, how will this be enforced exactly?
    - What kind of questions will feedback forms ask? Tabbycat is highly configurable here; both in terms of the types of questions offered, and the option to only show them to certain types of participant (i.e. chairs, teams). Consider how these questions be used tactically to identify key issues (say discriminatory scoring) or identify people who should be promoted/demoted.
    - How will feedback be monitored, and how will this information feed back into the scores and allocations? At large tournaments it is not unusual for an adjudication core member to sit off each round to review and process feedback — there isn't really a good stretch of time to do it otherwise. However there are communication issues to manage here (adj-core members each only have incomplete information of feedback). It's also worth considering whether adj-cores will manually raise/lower test marks in order to adjust adjudicator's ratings to where they think they should be.

- It helps to have the adjudication core establish policies for somewhat common but niche problems. This way you know what to do when these cases arise and you can exclude/include a ballot quickly and get on with the next round. The most common issue here is what to do when an adjudicator can't give an adjudication because they are missing or incapacitated during the debate (i.e. drunk or visibly sleeping).
- If possible it's nice to know in advance when the tab will be released (i.e. on the last night; the day after; etc) as this often gets left to the last minute to be dedicated. Also the possibility of whether people can redact themselves from tabs should be raised, as that might be useful to inform participants of during rego/briefings. Some adjudication cores might also want to limit speaker tabs to only a certain number of places.
- How to handle conflict collection; particularly if teams can specify conflicts (see below section).

Conflicts (registration/equity/adjudication core)
-------------------------------------------------

- There should always be a *single* means of collecting conflicts (i.e. a Google Sheet/Form) all conflicts should go through it. Get in touch in with equity and registration in advance and make it clear that they should not make their own conflicts form (or if they've already made one, make sure you adopt it and have access/control of it). Conflicts data should never be spread across a loose collection of email/personal messages/spreadsheets; otherwise keeping track and knowing which ones have been entered into the system will be painful and error prone. Because the nature of this data is sensitive and evolving, there must be a single location where it can be recorded and verified as having been entered into the tab.
- Conflicts should, ideally, *only be gathered after a participants list has been published* and requests for conflicts data should be sent out as few times as possible. Most people will only fill this form in once, so it is vital that when asked to nominate conflicts that they have as much information as they need to do so comprehensively. Without a full participants list people will either nominate conflicts that are not present (wasting your time in cross-referencing data) or not realise someone is present and raise the conflict at a latter, less opportune time.
- In some circuits only adjudicators are allowed to nominate conflicts because of the risk of teams using conflicts 'tactically' to block adjudicators that they think are bad. However, having teams nominate conflicts can be useful: adjudicators may overlook a conflict or there may be equity-based reasons that a conflict is non-symmetrical or confidential. This can be handled in two ways:

    - Not allow teams to nominate conflicts during registration; but allow them to approach equity teams before, or during, the tournament to identify the conflict. Equity can then raise the issue with the tab team and adjudication core and it can be added to the tab.
    - Allow teams to nominate conflicts during registration; but have the adjudication core review the data for 'tactical' conflicts. These are usually relatively easily identified, although can be overlooked if the adjudication core does not know the  participants and/or if a non-blatant quantity are added. The adjudication core can then override the conflict, discuss it with the teams, or raise it with equity. However, if going down this route, the tab team should discuss with the adjudication core how to manage this process well-ahead of the tournament, and ensure they actually do review the conflicts prior to the first round — otherwise it will become a derailing distraction during critical time periods such as allocations.

- As mentioned in the previous section, the adjudication team (possibly with equity) should provide some degree of guidance about what kinds of debating-related conflicts should be provided. Obviously people should be able to self-define what constitutes a conflict, but there are circumstances where they are overly cautious and can be reassured that it is not necessary. The opposite problem may occur also, where many people may have a very high bar for what defines a conflict which could lead to perceptions of bias from other participants.
- In poorly-structured conflict forms, identifying exactly who is doing the conflicting and who is being conflicted is a nightmare. You want to structure the questions to minimise this ambiguity. A form should definitely ask:

    - Are you (the conflict-specifier) a team or an adjudicator?
    - Which institution are you from?
    - If part of a team, which team are you in?
    - Who are you conflicting?
    - Which institution are they from?
    - If they are in a team, which team is it?
    - For adjudicators: have previously attended any other institutions; or have other reasons to conflict entire institutions? If so, specify those institutions.

- Generally, it is preferable that each form nominates a single conflict, and people are asked to re-submit for each conflict they are adding.
- Adj-core members will often not nominate their own conflicts; presuming that they will notice and correct them during allocations. They often forget or overlook this. Their
conflicts should be entered as per normal.


Online/offline ballots and feedback
-----------------------------------

Placeholder: basic pros and cons; tradeoffs; etc


Scheduling (convenors / venue organisers)
-----------------------------------------

One of the easiest ways to have things run late is to set an unrealistic schedule. As much as possible the round/lunch/etc timing should conform to an even distribution of how long it takes to process results and create a draw/allocation; you don't want to be in a position where particular rounds have much too much or too little time to spend on allocations and other crucial tasks. This is something that should definitely be working on in conjunction with convenors and other critical parties before they lock down timing details with food suppliers or the venue hosts.

Note also that in most circumstances it is almost always preferable to create a draw and allocation for the first day of the next round at the night before. This time should be built in to the schedule of the previous day, and raised with the adjudication core so they don't expect to be able to immediately depart after the last day's rounds complete.

Below is the time taken within each round at Australs 2017. For context, this was neither a particular efficiently or inefficiently tabbed tournament. Notable details:

- The tournament was ~40 rooms each round and had access to 3-6 runners and data enterers. Paper ballots were pre-printed and distributed by runners to rooms prior to the debates starting, then collected some time after the 15m deliberation period. Feedback was submitted online.
- The adjudication core were neither particular slow or fast in allocating adjudicators compared to other adjudication cores in an Australs context where allocations are first automatically generated then extensively tweaked.
- There were no serious issues that delayed the tabbing of any particular round beyond the expected issues of last-minute draw changes, adjudicators producing incomprehensible ballots, etc.
- While the tab ran relatively quickly there were delays (or periods where allocations could take longer than typical) because of mismatches between the planned schedule and the optimal schedule from a tab perspective.
- A round at Australs takes around 2 hours from a debater's perspective: 30m of prep, ~60m for a debate, ~15m for deliberation, and ~15m for the oral adjudication and feedback.
- We didn't note the timing of data-entry in Round 8 as there was no time pressure. After data entry was finished, finalising and double-checking the breaks took through to ~7-8pm.

Tab Setup
=========

Setting up a tab site is the most technically challenging (or at least annoying) part of tabbing. It is where you need to reconcile large amounts of data and configure a variety of settings to ensure everything will run without issues during rounds. While this is often done a day or two before the tournament, ideally you should look to do as much as possible in the week or two beforehand.

Creating the site
-----------------

- Presuming you are using Tabbycat, and deploying to Heroku, read our documentation about the size of Postgres database your tournament will require. Setting up the correct size from the start is the best way to go, as transferring information at a later stage is a hassle.
- If the tournament (or the host society) has their own domain name consider whether you want to set up the tab site on the domain so that the URL is nicer.

Importing data: workflow
------------------------

- First check with registration people if their data is complete, and if not who is missing. If it's only a few people it's viable (for tab purposes) to use place-holders for them, as long as you remember to follow up and edit their data manually later.
- Familiarise yourself with the different methods for importing data into Tabbycat. If using the spreadsheet importer, know how to operate it, and how to transfer data from a local to Heroku-hosted copy. That said, importing using the visual importer is viable for larger tournaments if you are not comfortable with the command line.

    - Typically the process using the spreadsheet importer is to set-up the CSV files then try to import them into a local copy of Tabbycat database and verify it works.
    - It will likely take several tries for it to work due to minor mismatches in speaker/institution names etc. The importer usually will spit out errors when something is malformed/mis-formatted. Usually the process is to then reimport until everything passes without errors.
    - Once the import has passed you can then push database to live. Generally from then on any changes will be done to the live tab unless there are huge amounts of problems requiring a re-import.

Importing data: regions/societies
---------------------------------

- Societies will often have special names that they like to use in draws (that are not the same as their institution's name or acronym. These can be gathered from institutional reps or from prior tabs. When in doubt err on the colloquial / most recognisable name; particularly for formats where teams need to find each other prior to the debate.
- Determine the types of regions that will be assigned to institutions with adjudication core. This has impacts for the kinds of representation/diversity the tab can show during allocations.

Importing data: participants
----------------------------

- Check you have emails/phone numbers included in the imported sheets; there are useful to have on hand later for either emailing out feedback links or following up errant adjudicators.
- Often the easiest way to prepare the sheets to import is to create new tabs in the registration data sheet, and use referencing to automatically order and arrange their data into the format Tabbycat wants.
- Often some adjudicators, typically local independents, may not be available for all rounds. Try and find out who this affects and when; once data has been imported you can pre-check these adjudicators in and out of rounds.
- Remember that the swing team(s) also need to be imported.

Data import: venues
-------------------

- Ideally you want not just a list of rooms, but also of categories — i.e. what buildings or colour code a room belongs to.
- You also want some idea of priority; that is to say if some rooms are inconvenient (and you have more rooms than you need) they should be marked as a low priority so they will not be allocated.
- You should want to know if access to some rooms is conditional. After the data is imported you can use the check-in system to record this information into the tab.
- Registration should have collected information about accessibility requirements; they should be imported (or added post-import) as Venue Constraints.
- Generally you want to assign adjudication core members rooms that are close to the tab room. These can be either imported (or added post-import) as Venue Constraints.

Data import: test scores
------------------------

- Ideally the adjudication core should do this themselves as they are marking the test.

Data import: user accounts
--------------------------

- Set up user accounts for the adjudication core
- Set up user accounts for runners/assistants with dummy passwords (they can change them later)

Emailing out links
------------------

- For international tournaments the use online ballots or online feedback, participants should be emailed out their private URLs before people start travelling to arrive at a tournament (i.e. when they have a reasonable chance of checking their email). This can be done using the inbuilt pages on Tabbycat, or by importing participants data into a service such as Mailchimp.

Pre-Rounds Setup
================

Setting up the tab room
-----------------------

This is typically the first order of business, as all future pre-round setup tasks (i.e. training the adjudication core, testing printing, etc) are better for being done in the same space that will be used throughout the rounds. Once you're in the space there are a couple of small checks to run through before the larger question of how to arrange and use the space should be tackled:

- Check with convenors whether things can be left in the tab room overnight. If they can't you'll need to make plans for how to move any big items (printers; ballot stacks) to and from the tab room each day.
- Check that the internet access in the tab room is reliable
- Check that the projector system works, both with whatever wired-in computer is in the room and when connected to your laptop.
- Check what items either yourself, or the organisers, have at hand and check if anything needs to be acquired before the next day. Critical items for tab rooms are typically:

    - An extension cord with multi box; ideally a pair of each
    - Whiteboard markers (assuming there is a whiteboard) otherwise permanent markers and large sheets of paper (i.e. A2) can suffice
    - Boxes. Lots of boxes. Loose ballots are a source of confusion and error, so you want some way of temporarily storing ballots as they proceed through the entering and checking process. You probably want at least three large boxes (for ballots to-enter, ballots to-check, and finished ballots) but more will be useful.
    - Spare printing ink/toner, and paper for the printer. Ideally your paper would be multi-coloured, with each colour being used for a different round. Pastel colours are ideal, and you ideally want at least three different colours so that you don't have to repeat a colour within the same day. Be sure to calculate how many sheets you will need per round and ensure you have a generous amount of spares.
    - If tabbing a format that can produce multiple ballots per-debate, staplers are essential to keep those ballots organised. Buy at least two sturdy types.

- Non-essential, but often useful to have items:

    - Whatever dongles/adapters you need to connect your laptop to the projectors, both in the tab room and in the briefing room.
    - Post-it notes aren't a great way to temporarily mark ballots with information; typically used to indicate ballots that need correcting.
    - You'll often need to make impromptu signs; sticky tape and/or blu-tack are good here
    - Spare pens for the people doing data entry to use
    - Trash bags for collecting rubbish as it accumulates
    - A Chrome Cast can occasionally be very useful if a projector or screen doesn't have accessible input cables or so that you can use a projector without having your laptop tethered to a particular podium and desk.

If you haven't already it's a good idea to check your printing setup by printing off a bunch of generic ballots and feedback forms to have on hand if the need arises (i.e. a ballot is missing and needs to go out ASAP; or if someone can't do feedback online and needs to do so on paper). At worst, the blank ballots you print can be used for the out-rounds. While printing these off time how long it takes the printer to print say 25 ballots and extrapolate from that to figure out how long it will take to print the entire round's worth of ballots. Note that if printing off a round's ballots is relatively quick it can be useful to delay it in order to better accommodate any last-minute changes to the draw that happen post-announcement. It's also worth thinking about how you (or at least who will) group up the printed ballots in order to distribute them to runners.

At this point you should also setup whatever process you need for managing runners and the ballot collection process. At a minimum this should probably be a table on a spreadsheet or a whiteboard listing the different groups of rooms, with space to mark in which runners are delivering/collecting ballots for each location. This will likely change from day to day and should be kept updated. It should also have some method for contacting each runner (i.e. a cellphone number).

The question of how to arrange the actual room is one with many answers, and is obviously shaped by the peculiarities of the space itself. However there needs to be some system behind it so that people know exactly where to go and what to do when there is time pressure.

The key consideration behind this system is typically the 'flow' of ballots: what happens after they are brought back from runners but before they are completely entered into the system. Think through how you want this process to operate and how the space can be arranged to make each step as smooth as possible. Considerations:

- When runners initially return a big stack of ballots, what happens? They could be transferred directly to the data-enterers to start on, but it is often useful to have preliminary checks here in order to keep the job of the data-enterers as simple as possible. These checks could include:

    - For formats with multiple ballots per-debate, you typically want to identify and staple together all the ballots from a given room.
    - For tournaments where ballots are liable to go missing (or for when you have plenty of data-enterers and want peace of mind) it is worth using the ballot 'check-in' system of your tab software to mark off ballots as present in the tab room. This allows you to quickly identify which ballots are AWOL and begin tracking them down earlier than you would do otherwise if just waiting for the 'to enter' pile to be exhausted.
    - Depending on your preferences and resources, ballots could at this stage be checked for errors. This could include a basic sweep for missing information (i.e. totals) or a comprehensive sweep that includes checking math errors, ambiguous handwriting, low-point wins, etc). While this will delay the time between ballots arriving and being entered, it will mean that you can start correcting ballots sooner, and lessens the burden on (potentially inexperienced) data-enterers to check and catch these.

- Once this preliminary step has occurred the next task is actually entering the ballots. The number of steps here is dependent on your tab software and tab settings; you might have had the 'draft' ballot be submitted online by chairs or you might have the whole two step process of a 'draft' ballot entry and the 'confirmed' ballot entry taking place within the tab room. Considerations:

    - Regardless of whether you are working with a one-step or a two-step process, you want to arrange the tables where data-enterers are sitting such that their need to move is minimised. That might mean either have a central inbox of ballots to enter in the center of the tables (such that everyone can reach it) or having multiple 'clusters' of enterers around boxes.
    - If work with a two-step process you want those two steps to be an active part of the spatial arrangement. That is to say, typically there will be a grouping of enterers who are working on the initial ballot entry (clustered around a box or boxes) and then a separate 'downstream' grouping of enterers that work on confirming/validating those entries. Depending on the size of tournament and quantity of runners, you either want it so that individuals from the first group can easily pass their ballots to the box of the second group; i.e. by reaching across the table or walking a short distance. At large tournaments you might want a dedicated person to transfer ballots between boxes to prevent enterers having to get up.
    - In a two-step process people may need to transfer roles, as generally you want to prioritise entry and then validation. Often this isn't necessarily much more efficient, but if 'rebalancing' the roles make sure that the spaces assigned to each role can accommodate extra people, and that people physically move to occupy each role.
    - In general, you want to minimise the number of ballots that each enterer feels the need to 'hoard' to work through to keep the work evenly distributed. If people are taking a large amount of ballots to work, at the final stages of entering some people will have a bunch to work through while others will be finished. Making it easy to collect and pass on ballots in the space itself helps cut down on this while keeping entry efficient.
    - While the exact spatial arrangement depends on your numbers and what furniture is available, a long rectangle is a good starting point as the ballot process is in general linear (check, enter, validate, finish). Typically this might look like a series of tables in a row with enterers sitting on either side and with the various ballot boxes in the middle.
    - When ballots have finished being enter/validated there definitely should be some sort of final 'done' box. However take care how ballots are put here, a common source of error is people putting ballots there before they are fully finished.
    - When ballots need to be corrected you generally want to 'extract' them from this process and hand them off to a tab-director or assistant to chase up and collect. There should be a forethought process for managing this; and ideally a dedicated space for it to prevent ballots being lost and to make it easy to identify ongoing issues. This might look like a process of sticking a post it note (outlining the error) to the ballot, and then pulling it from entry/validation and placing it on a desk.

Training volunteers
-------------------

If it all feasible you want to train that volunteers acting as runners and/or data enterers they day before the tournament starts otherwise the first round will be rough. It's generally a good idea for this training session to generally mirror the process of running a round. Even if you have enough people for dedicated runner/enterer roles to train everyone so that they are familiar with each and can fill in if needed. This has a couple of stages:

1. Introductions/details

    - Volunteering is a pretty thankless and often stressful job. It's also quite a dull and mechanical process: deliver paper; collect paper; enter numbers; check numbers.
    As much as possible you want your volunteers to feel welcome and a key part of a team. When meeting everyone for the first time try and run the introductions in a non-perfunctory manner and get to know people's background/interests and outline how valuable they are to the tournament.
    - As part of this process you should, however, grab their cellphone number or whatever means you will use to coordinate communication.
    - Figure out what will be happening during downtime. Would volunteers like to watch debates, work in the tab room, etc. Is there anything they would like during those down times (music, snacks, coffee, etc).

2. Rooms and Running

    - So if runners are unfamiliar with debating in general, outline the basics of what draws are, what ballots are actually for, and what this process looks like for participants.
    - Outline how/when the printing process occurs, who will sort and assign the ballots.
    - Now is a good time to assign different runners to different venue groups.
    - Critically (and this may take some time) as a group actually go to everyone one of the venue groups and identify all of the venue rooms that are listed so that everyone knows exactly where to go. This is a good chance to both check those rooms actually exist and any problems that might occur finding them.
    - Go through where to place ballots on desks
    - Outline in general what happens during ballot collecting: when to do it, how to approach chairs, what do to if they are slow or delayed. You should raise the chance of chairs being belligerent and outline how you (and they) should deal with this.
    - If you are having runners pre-check ballots it's a good idea to fill out a few ballots to demonstrate the kinds of checking. If you are using any communication systems (i.e. having them mark of buildings as 'done') go through that now also.

3. Data entry and checking

    - Again, run through this in the actual tab room, and illustrate examples with actual ballots.
    - Before starting set up logins for everyone and show them how to login. Also get an idea of what devices they will be using, or can bring, for data entry purposes. Check/ensure that they will have internet access on those devices.
    - Run through how the seating/table/box arrangement works and the types of roles at different positions.
    - Emphasise that in general, any ambiguities should be raised with the tab directors/assistants; i.e. that you should never guess about ballots but instead always delegate resolving issues to someone else.
    - Run through the different edge cases and things to check during entry. For example Iron Person speeches, mismatched totals, entering the wrong ballot for the wrong panellist, etc (see section below). Be sure to also go through what happens when the validation step fails; i.e. when a ballot needs to be re-entered.

Training the adjudication core
------------------------------

Typically making the first round draw and allocation is a good time to outline expectations and roles with the adjudication core. Generous amounts of time should be budgeted for this. Things to run through:

- Setting up logins for the adjudication core as necessary
- Outlining (if you haven't already) how feedback will work, as well as the means by which the adjudication core can use the software to keep track of feedback. Ideally some sort of general strategy should be formed for this, so that particular people sit out rounds, or are delegate the task of catching up on feedback at other points.
- Depending on how many runners you have it may be necessary, or beneficial, if the adjudication core helps out with data entry. However if you go down this route the adjudication core need to be highly trained; they are often much more likely than volunteers (who are less self-confident and have more experience) to make errors.
- Ensure that adjudication core members know to come to the tab room ASAP after they have finished adjudications rather than swanning around socialising or going to lunch. Draws will often be held up just by the fact that not enough adjudication core members are present to start or finish an allocation.
- The first round allocation is a chance to slowly walk the adjudication core through the allocation interface. They should know how to operate it themselves and what it's capabilities are. This includes key interface features (say those that assign a debate 'importance' or 'energy') as well as how the underpinning technology works (say how importance/energy matches up to panel strength). As much as possible you want to understand their priorities and ensure the software is configured to match them, and/or highlight interface features that help them match it.
- How to approach diversity (typically in terms of region and gender) across an allocation in particular is something that some members of an adjudication core will not have had to considered in the context of a large tournament or in terms of explicit trade-offs. Again, you should make it clear how the software can accommodate this, and get the team to plan for how (in general) they want to approach this. Often it will form the final phase of the allocation process, and so can easily be forgotten or skipped over.
- Outline that there will usually be a trade-off between the quality of each allocations and the speed at which the tournament runs. When time is not a factor, many adjudication cores will often take an hour or more in order to create a perfect allocation; they should know though that aiming for perfect during many rounds will break the schedule. You should try and get them to set some sort of time goal for allocations, and ensure that they are aware of when (during the rounds) they are going too fast or too slow.
- How you will all communicate. Again, there should be a single medium for this so that everyone knows what is going on.

Preparing a briefing
--------------------

- At large tournaments there should be some form of briefing covering ballots and feedback process, even if it is just quick one. Usually you will want to be the person to design and deliver this; other people less-familiar with the system may miss details.
- Liaise with convenors and the other people doing briefings to ensure (a) they know you're doing one; and (b) you are not overlapping in terms of content.
- See the last section of this document for notes on what can be useful to include here

Final checks
------------

- Check if the convenors have made a map that clearly outlines where the rooms are. Ensure it's clear and post it to either the tab site (ideally) or somewhere like Facebook.
- Check that convenors have some sort of way-finding system in place, i.e. chalked directions or colour-coded signs. Check these colour codes match the names of your venues.
- Check that the draw types are correct for each round in the tab system.
- Check with adjudication core if/when there are secret rounds and that these are correct in the edit data base area.
- Check how the draw will be displayed and managed. Is the projector good; how big does the text size need to be? How fast is the scroll?
- If you will pre-print ballots check that you've set the "return ballots to" configuration setting; even if it just says "to runners".

Managing Rounds
===============


Incoming ballots
----------------

At large tournaments important to know as soon as possible rooms that are late or ballots that are missing. This means:

- Checking off ballots as they come in
- Having an app to keep track of which rooms have been collected that runners use. IE
    - Ballot delivered
    - Debate begun
    - Debate ended
    - Adjudication ended/ ballot collected
    - Ballot returned
    - Ballot in tab room

Placeholder: talk about the critical path; how it is disrupted. i.e. rarely is rare data entering power the key hold up, rather single ballots

Entering data
-------------

- By the time things are say roughly half done ensure the adj core is present or on their way back so they wont hold up allocations


Bad ballots
-----------

- Really isn't a good way to stop this. Many have tried. At best it can be mitigated and managed.
- This will be worse at international tournaments, and especially in circuits where there is more than one predominant format
- Shaming and binning, while fun, probably isn't effective
- Changing or adding middle names of adjudicators though is a good way to remind them, and other people (it shows on the draw/pre-printed ballots but will be truncated in the allocation UI).

    - i.e. John ‘Can't Add' Smith
    - i.e. Jane ‘Bad Handwriting' Smith
    - Alternately, an emoji code; John 😡 Smith

- Australs mess-ups included:
    - Incorrect math
    - Just not adding properly
    - Not including reply scores in the totals
    - Changing individual scores but not updating the totals/margins
    - Ti.e. ballots (ie. Their written margin indicated a winner but their speaker scores - summed to equal each other)
    - Illegible speaker scores/scores that had numbers traced over them
    - Forgetting motion vetoes (not a critical problem, but still annoying)
    - Scoring outside the range (esp. For reply scores)
    - Missing totals/winners/margins


Allocating adjudicators
-----------------------

- Often need to remind adjs to check gender and region as they forget it can do it

Ongoing processes/checks
------------------------

- Language status will affect who can break in what categories and thus what priority teams should get regarding adjudicators. Thus liaise with a language committee so that as soon as determinations are made the eligibility can be entered into tabby cat. You definitely want this in by say round 5 when the algorithm can start determining which teams are live in a way that helps allocations.
- If teams eligible for multiple breaks are only allowed to participate in one break (eg. if there are out-rounds running concurrently, etc.), ensure the language committee is also recording those preferences
- Try and ensure the room is not devolving into mess.
- Keep an eye on feedback; ideally with an adjudication core member present
- Heroku metrics. should be looking for the number of "timeout errors". up dynos as a response. these could be an issue during results release
- Backups; how to take them. Don't just take them; download them. Ideally to a dropbox or something that will spread them across multiple computers

Planning for the worst
----------------------

- If internet goes out, or if the online service hosted has an outage
- Need to know how to restore a backup onto a local copy and start working with that
- i.e. have a local copy setup already


Breaks and Break Rounds
=======================

Generating the adjudicator's break
----------------------------------

Determining the adjudicator break generally involves a complex set of considerations rather than strictly ranking based on feedback. As such most adjudication cores will use whiteboards or Google docs to draft and discuss the possible options. One thing to note here is that breaking adjudicators will need to be marked as such in the tab at some point (both so they can be on future draws, and for publication) so you want to be careful that the tab is the final source of authority here — it is easy for information to get out of sync between what the adjudication core is using to draft the break and the system. Points that are possibly be worth raising here are an idea of the *quantity* of adjudicators needed (breaking too few or too many will cause issues) and whether there are any special considerations (such as having conflicts with large portions of the draw, or leaving at a given point) with a given adjudicator.

Generating the team break
-------------------------

Before doing so in an automated fashion, first check whether all teams are assigned to the right break categories. Check also that each break category is using the right rule — by default (in Tabbycat at least) each break uses a generic ranking rather than the specified rules of tournaments such as Australs. While there also double check the break size itself is correct.

Hopefully the automated system will generate a correct break, but this should always be checked against what you'd expect the results to be from standings. Note also that there are cases, such as when a team has to leave, or when teams are or are not double-breaking that mean the automated break results need to be overridden (typically in Tabbycat you would add a marker or note to include their ranking, but exclude them from having a break rank).

Announcing the break
--------------------

Mistakes are made surprisingly often when announcing the results. Again this is often a problem with incomplete or out of sync data, where print-outs, or slides, or the tab site itself might not reflect, for example, last minute changes about breaks, or potentially confuse teams or adjudicators with similar names. Things that can help:

- Have a single source for what is being read out — i.e. a printed list (recommended) or the tab site itself; but don't mix and match. If making slides (often a good idea for large/crowded venues) copy the data from the canonical source being announced.
- Double check what is being read out against the tab site, and/or whatever draft lists were used to say determine the adjudicators break. Verify everyone who should be there is, and that nobody is missing.
- Without revealing any details try and get at least some guidance on how to pronounce names that people don't know how to pronounce.
- Have backup copies of whatever is being read from and clarify who is reading off what portions.
- Clarify the general order in which things are read; i.e. *wins* then *team points* then *team name*.

Managing the out-rounds
-----------------------

Out-rounds are generally under less time pressure and can be managed by just one or two members of the tab team. However they tend to be run in a more haphazard fashion, so there are a couple of things to keep on top of:

- You should keep track of which adjudicators have or have not been used throughout the finals allocations. It is easy for adjudication cores to forget to allocate someone and have to either drop them or promote them beyond what they had originally intended.
- When managing out-round with multiple break categories, the round progression is no longer strictly linear. So be careful with announcements, and note that often you can't rely on the online interface to release draws publicly.
- It is very easy for ballots to get lost in break rounds as chairs have less defined roles and processes in what they do with their ballots. While having correct speaker scores correctly entered for break rounds isn't a strict necessity, it is nice to have and the alternative (using fake speaks just to record the winner) can cause confusion.  Closely manage distributing ballots to the chairs and collecting them as soon as possible afterwards; especially if there is any time pressure. Generally it is not worth printing off per-debate ballots; just print a stack of generic ballots at the start of the out-rounds and distribute as needed.
- You should know, in addition to when the break rounds are, when the results announcements are. Often these announcements are saved (for suspense or logistics reasons) until particular points of time (i.e. until the evening social; or until other out-rounds are finished). Obviously it's important not to accidentally release results; but often convenors and the adjudication core will often have different ideas about when results are meant to be released.

Preparing for tab release
--------------------------

At some point, if you haven't already, have a discussion about when the tab itself will be released; and what data will be released. Note that in addition to the basic speaker and team tabs, Tabbycat can also optionally release motion statistics, participant demographics, and the per-ballot results of each round, along with 'filtered' speaker tabs for say Novice or ESL speakers.

Well before the tab is due to be released you want to check that anonymisations and any speaker flags (i.e. Novice, ESL) are up to date.

Managing the tab release
------------------------

Almost there!

If hosting Tabbycat on Heroku it's worth increasing the resources available to the server for the ~12 hour period following tab release; it's by far the most concentrated burst of traffic the site will receive. Because Heroku bills by the hour, even going to a relatively expensive option, such as performance dynos with auto-scaling, will be very cheap if run just for this period. That said the site should be relatively resilient even in the face of large amounts of traffic; even running with the most basic resources allocated, at worst pages will be temporarily slow or not load.

To get an idea of how the site is performing in the Heroku dashboard keep an eye on the average request time number and adjust the number of dynos to try and keep it under say two seconds; ideally just one. When you first turn on the tab release settings, make sure you go through and load every page before announcing it to the public, doing so will trigger the caching mechanism that means potentially complex pages (say the speaker tab) don't need to be calculated from scratch each time someone loads the page.

Appendix: Briefing Notes
========================

This is a very loose, but not exhaustive, collection of things that are useful to communicate to participants in a tab briefing; or to make clear to them in some other fashion before the tournament.

While 'briefing fatigue' is real, having clear expectations about how things like ballots and feedback work are highly valuable uses of the tournament's time if they at all can help cut down problems that can cause delays in the future.

How feedback works
------------------

- Is it online, or offline? If online did people receive links? What do they do if they have lost it?
- Is feedback mandatory? What accountability mechanisms are there? Will you publish the shame list online or raise it in between rounds?
- Who will be submitting feedback on who? Do trainees do so?
- Remind teams that only one of their feedbacks count; they should coordinate who is doing it.
- What is the feedback scale? What does it correspond to? Common sources of confusion:

    - Feedback scales are not like Uber. You do not get five stars for being adequate and generic.
    - Feedback scales are not relative to position; it is an absolute scale. That is to say if your trainee was good, they probably do not deserve the highest rating; they get whatever rating indicates they should be a panellist or low-chair.
    - Consider accompanying the score/scale with a statement characterising how these numbers correspond to positions - e.g. a 4.0 means 'should continue on good panels, should chair low rooms'

- If using online submission options, what should people without phones or internet access do?

How ballots work
----------------

This part of the presentation will be condescending. It is also necessary. The two causes of delays in the draw running late, and thus the tournament running late are (1) people not filling out ballots correctly or (2) people's ballots going missing. Emphasise that this should be taken seriously; minutes spent chasing bad ballots are often minutes that delay every single person at the tournament from doing what they are actually here to do.

You should highlight, ideally with illustrated examples:

- Which parts of the ballot *must* be filled in; people will often overlook margins, or special fields such as motion vetoes.
- That people must specify full names; not nicknames or just-first names. Often names will be written poorly or have ambiguities (i.e. two speakers on a team called James) and having full names removes these.
- That people should **not draw arrows to swap the order of speakers** as these are impossible to decipher. Here, and in other areas, always *cross-out* information clearly and write it again rather than using arrows or drawing over what is there.
- That people should try and write numbers in a manner that makes them crystal clear. Put cross-bars in 7s; bases on 1's. Make 8's actually look like two circles. If people know they have poor handwriting maybe consider writing the literal words — *seventy-one* below the numbers.
- That for styles that do not have a single ballot for a panel, reiterate that everyone fills in their own ballots. At Australs, if this isn't made absolutely clear someone will average their panels ballots in order to try and 'help' you.
- That runners do not fill out ballots. In BP, remind them that only chairs should fill out ballots (i.e. it cannot be deputised to a wing). In formats with individual ballots, remind chairs to make sure their wings have actually filled out a ballot, and get them to check for errors or ambiguities.
- That everyone is bad at math. People who think they are good at math just haven't messed up their ballot *yet*. Emphasize that people should always use their phone's calculators to check totals. At typical tournaments math errors happen multiple times a round, almost every round.
- How long people have to fill out their ballots. Suggest that chairs actually keep track of this time during a stopwatch, and start moving towards critical steps (i.e. scoring) well *before* the time is up, not *once* it is up.
- Outline what chairs should do to return ballots. If ballots are being run by runners, outline what they should do if a runner doesn't appear. If they are not being run by runners remind people that returning ballots should be there number one priority, over say giving a lengthy adjudication or team feedback. Or getting lunch.
- Remind people to *be nice to runners* and that being mean to runners will have serious consequences.
- Remind people that the tab team and adjudication core will not, except for absolutely exceptional circumstances, accept photos or descriptions of ballots; that all results must be on paper and handled in the same manner. The adjudication core should also be reminded of this.

How to locate the tab room
--------------------------

People should know how to get to the tab room, either to raise issues with the adjudication core or to correct ballot errors. Make it crystal clear where it is an how to get there. Also ensure people know not to barge in; that they should knock and wait.

Also clearly communicate the contact details of the tab directors and get people to take them down. In most cases you do not want people going through convenors or the adjudication core for any tab-related issues.

Misc
----

Given this is probably the most visible point of the tab team, outside of being angry at adjudicators or being thanked during the closing ceremony, now is a good time to encourage people in general to consider helping with tabbing and tab-development. Emphasize that both do not necessarily require technical skills and that tabbers are (or should be) open to feedback and ideas from the wider community. Tell people to come find you and chat and/or link to the `Facebook tabbing group <https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681761898801915/?ref=bookmarks>`_.

If you appreciated this guide or Tabbycat we'd appreciate a slide promoting `Timekept <http://timekept.com>`_ and `Debatekeeper <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.czlee.debatekeeper&hl=en>`_. This would also be a good point to remind people that their timekeeping apps shouldn't be making noise *unless* they have been explicitly assigned to keep time by the chair.
